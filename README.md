# CS5275 The Algorithm Designer's Toolkit

This course introduces students to a diverse variety of algorithmic and mathematical techniques that are commonly encountered in computer science. We will specifically cover fundamental and widely-used ideas involving asymptotic analysis, concentration bounds, Fourier analysis, error-correcting codes, the probabilistic method, optimization, communication complexity, expanders, and computational hardness. If time permits, we will also cover a small number of more specialized topics such as spectral graph theory, random matrices, or quantum algorithms.
